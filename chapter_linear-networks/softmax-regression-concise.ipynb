    "and $o_j$ is the $j^\\mathrm{th}$ element of the logits\n",
    "$\\mathbf{o}$.\n",
    "If some of the $o_k$ are very large (i.e., very positive),\n",
    "then $\\exp(o_k)$ might be larger than the largest number\n",
    "we can have for certain data types (i.e., *overflow*).\n",
    "This would make the denominator (and/or numerator) `inf` (infinity)\n",
    "and we wind up encountering either 0, `inf`, or `nan` (not a number) for $\\hat y_j$.\n",
