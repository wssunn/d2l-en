    "In this sense, it is very similar to what we saw in regression,\n",
    "where the gradient was the difference\n",
    "between the observation $y$ and estimate $\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "This is not coincidence.\n",

    "but an entire distribution over outcomes.\n",
    "We can use the same representation as before for the label $\\mathbf{y}$.\n",
    "The only difference is that rather than a vector containing only binary entries,\n",
    "say $(0, 0, 1)$, we now have a generic probability vector, say $(0.1, 0.2, 0.7)$.\n",

    "## Information Theory Basics\n",
    ":label:`subsec_info_theory_basics`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Information theory* deals with the problem of encoding, decoding, transmitting,\n",
    "and manipulating information (also known as data) in as concise form as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea in information theory is to quantify the information content in data.\n",
    "This quantity places a hard limit on our ability to compress the data.\n",
    "In information theory, this quantity is called the *entropy* of a distribution $P$,\n",
    "and it is captured by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H[P] = \\sum_j - P(j) \\log P(j).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_softmax_reg_entropy`\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental theorems of information theory states\n",
    "that in order to encode data drawn randomly from the distribution $P$,\n",
    "we need at least $H[P]$ \"nats\" to encode it.\n",
    "If you wonder what a \"nat\" is, it is the equivalent of bit\n",
    "but when using a code with base $e$ rather than one with base 2.\n",
    "Thus, one nat is $\\frac{1}{\\log(2)} \\approx 1.44$ bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surprisal\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering what compression has to do with prediction.\n",
    "Imagine that we have a stream of data that we want to compress.\n",
    "If it is always easy for us to predict the next token,\n",
    "then this data is easy to compress!\n",
    "Take the extreme example where every token in the stream always takes the same value.\n",
    "That is a very boring data stream!\n",
    "And not only it is boring, but it is also easy to predict.\n",
    "Because they are always the same, we do not have to transmit any information\n",
    "to communicate the contents of the stream.\n",
    "Easy to predict, easy to compress.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if we cannot perfectly predict every event,\n",
    "then we might sometimes be surprised.\n",
    "Our surprise is greater when we assigned an event lower probability.\n",
    "Claude Shannon settled on $\\log \\frac{1}{P(j)} = -\\log P(j)$\n",
    "to quantify one's *surprisal* at observing an event $j$\n",
    "having assigned it a (subjective) probability $P(j)$.\n",
    "The entropy defined in :eqref:`eq_softmax_reg_entropy` is then the *expected surprisal*\n",
    "when one assigned the correct probabilities\n",
    "that truly match the data-generating process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Entropy Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "So if entropy is level of surprise experienced\n",
    "by someone who knows the true probability,\n",
    "then you might be wondering, what is cross-entropy?\n",
    "The cross-entropy *from* $P$ *to* $Q$, denoted $H(P, Q)$,\n",
    "is the expected surprisal of an observer with subjective probabilities $Q$\n",
    "upon seeing data that were actually generated according to probabilities $P$.\n",
    "The lowest possible cross-entropy is achieved when $P=Q$.\n",
    "In this case, the cross-entropy from $P$ to $Q$ is $H(P, P)= H(P)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can think of the cross-entropy classification objective\n",
    "in two ways: (i) as maximizing the likelihood of the observed data;\n",
    "and (ii) as minimizing our surprisal (and thus the number of bits)\n",
    "required to communicate the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Prediction and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the softmax regression model, given any example features,\n",
    "we can predict the probability of each output class.\n",
    "Normally, we use the class with the highest predicted probability as the output class.\n",
    "The prediction is correct if it is consistent with the actual class (label).\n",
    "In the next part of the experiment,\n",
    "we will use *accuracy* to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "This is equal to the ratio between the number of correct predictions and the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The softmax operation takes a vector and maps it into probabilities.\n",
    "* Softmax regression applies to classification problems. It uses the probability distribution of the output class in the softmax operation.\n",
    "* Cross-entropy is a good measure of the difference between two probability distributions. It measures the number of bits needed to encode the data given our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can explore the connection between exponential families and the softmax in some more depth.\n",
    "    1. Compute the second derivative of the cross-entropy loss $l(\\mathbf{y},\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ for the softmax.\n",
    "    1. Compute the variance of the distribution given by $\\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{o})$ and show that it matches the second derivative computed above.\n",
    "1. Assume that we have three classes which occur with equal probability, i.e., the probability vector is $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n",
    "    1. What is the problem if we try to design a binary code for it?\n",
    "    1. Can you design a better code? Hint: what happens if we try to encode two independent observations? What if we encode $n$ observations jointly?\n",
    "1. Softmax is a misnomer for the mapping introduced above (but everyone in deep learning uses it). The real softmax is defined as $\\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(a, b) = \\log (\\exp(a) + \\exp(b))$.\n",
    "    1. Prove that $\\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(a, b) > \\mathrm{max}(a, b)$.\n",
    "    1. Prove that this holds for $\\lambda^{-1} \\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(\\lambda a, \\lambda b)$, provided that $\\lambda > 0$.\n",
    "    1. Show that for $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ we have $\\lambda^{-1} \\mathrm{RealSoftMax}(\\lambda a, \\lambda b) \\to \\mathrm{max}(a, b)$.\n",
    "    1. What does the soft-min look like?\n",
    "    1. Extend this to more than two numbers.\n",
